# What should I know about GCP as a MLOps engineer & Data Scientist?

As a MLOps engineer and data scientist working with Google Cloud Platform (GCP), there are several key things you should know:

1.GCP services for machine learning: GCP provides a number of services for machine learning, including Google Cloud AI Platform, which allows you to train, deploy, and manage machine learning models at scale. Other services include AutoML, which allows you to build custom machine learning models without requiring expertise in machine learning, and TensorFlow, an open-source machine learning framework.

2.Data storage and management: GCP provides several services for data storage and management, including Cloud Storage for object storage, Cloud SQL for relational databases, and BigQuery for data warehousing and analytics. As a data scientist, you'll need to be familiar with these services and how to integrate them with your machine learning workflows.

3.Big Data processing: GCP provides several services for processing big data, including Google Cloud Dataflow for batch and streaming data processing, and Dataproc for managing Hadoop and Spark clusters. As a data scientist, you'll need to be familiar with these services and how to use them to process and analyze large datasets.

4.Deployment options: GCP provides a number of deployment options for machine learning models, including containerizing models with Docker and deploying them on Kubernetes clusters, using Cloud Functions to deploy serverless models, and deploying models as REST APIs with Cloud Endpoints.

5.Monitoring and logging: GCP provides several tools for monitoring and logging, including Stackdriver, which allows you to monitor your applications and infrastructure in real time, and Cloud Logging, which allows you to store, search, and analyze logs from your applications and services.

6.Security and compliance: GCP provides several tools for ensuring security and compliance, including Identity and Access Management (IAM), which allows you to control access to your resources, and Cloud Security Command Center, which provides centralized visibility and control over your security posture.

7.Automation and orchestration: GCP provides several tools for automation and orchestration, including Cloud Deployment Manager, which allows you to automate the creation and deployment of GCP resources, and Cloud Composer, which provides a managed workflow orchestration service based on Apache Airflow.
